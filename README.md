# Description
I built this handy little tool because resolving code conflicts in PO files with thousands of translations is very tedious. With this tool you can merge any number of po files you want. The resulting PO file will have all the unique translations from all the po files passed as arguments

# Example
` python3 main.py {po file 1} {po file 2} `

# Note
The file generated can have some duplicates
